# COM3529 Software Testing and Analysis

Welcome to the "COM3529 Software Testing and Analysis" module at the University
of Sheffield! This repository contains code examples to support the lecture
material and practical sessions for the first five weeks of the module,
including the first assignment.

You will need to do a `git pull` each week to get the latest materials.

It has three main directories:

* [`code`](./code) – where all code examples from the lectures and needed for
  the practicals and first assignment live. (More information about how to use
  the code examples will be covered in the first practical session in week 1.)

* [`slides`](./slides) - where PDFs of the slides presented in lectures and
  practical classes live

* [`practicals`](./practicals) - where Markdown files for the practical sessions
  and instructions for the first assignment live.

### Problems or Feedback

Any feedback or constructive criticism that you may have is welcomed.

If you are experiencing problems with using the repository, please contact the
module lecturer that owns it – [Phil McMinn](https://mcminn.io).
